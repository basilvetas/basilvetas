# About Me

I am most interested in technologies, lifestyles and worldviews that have the capacity to improve the human condition. My background is in economics, computer science and mathematics. I currently work at [Arthena](https://arthena.com/) and study data science at Columbia University. Previously I was a software developer at JPMorgan and Qualtrics focusing on data visualization. I've also worked for a venture capital/impact investing fund and with a number of startups. Originally from Salt Lake City, I now live in Manhattan.

This site is a platform for me to share things that I find interesting and to draw attention to topics that deserve more of it. But it's also a space to dissect my thoughts and learn as I go, so dialogue and constructive criticism are very much encouraged. Over time, I hope that the content found here will, at least for some readers, serve as a source of optimism about the future.
